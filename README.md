# Gui-Tic-Tac-Toe
This was my firts GUI project in python.
The problem that I am currently having, is II seem to have an inability to run anything unless is it part of a function called by a button, this is making it very hard to try to build a scoring system or an AI

Due to my inexperience with tkinter this project is now on hold until i gain a little bit more experience with functions and passing variables. 

Any help is appriated, thanks
